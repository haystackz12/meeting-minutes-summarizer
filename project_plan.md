## 1  Project Overview
The **Meeting Minutes Summarizer** is a Streamlit web application that lets users upload an audio recording of a meeting, transcribe it with OpenAI Whisper, and generate a concise summary with GPT-4. Summaries can be downloaded in **TXT** or **PDF** formats and viewed in-app through a clean, dark-themed UI.

## 2  Objectives & Scope
| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Rapid MVP** | Build a working prototype in a single dev cycle. |
| **Zero-install UX** | Host on Streamlit Cloud so anyone can run it in a browser. |
| **Configurable summaries** | Provide Executive, Bullet, and Email styles. |
| **Export options** | Permit downloads as `.txt` or `.pdf`. |

Out-of-scope: user authentication, persistent storage, multi-language support (v1 only handles English).
